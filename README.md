# Lift Simulation

I am creating lift simulation project that is popular among RDS devs in React.

[Refer Here](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/Lift-Simulation)

Approach
1. Create the config view that can be used for keeping track of floors and lifts.\
2. Create floors, lifts and up and down buttons.
3. Add functionality to move lifts when up and down bettons are clicked.
